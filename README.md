# pima-indians-diabetes-prediction
This repo consists of basic logistic regression model and K-Nearest Neighbor model built using scikit-learn ML package. It gives basic knowledge of how we can build classification predictive analytics model using sklearn and test our model. The Pima Indians Diabetes dataset is obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database).
